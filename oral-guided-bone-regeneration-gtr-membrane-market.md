<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oral Guided Bone Regeneration (GTR) Membrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Membrane</li><li>Non-absorbable Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Oral Guided Bone Regeneration (GTR) Membrane Market includes two types of membranes: absorbable membranes and non-absorbable membranes. Absorbable membranes are made from materials that degrade over time, allowing new bone to grow. They eliminate the need for a second surgery to remove the membrane. Non-absorbable membranes, on the other hand, are made from materials that do not degrade and may need to be removed in a separate procedure. Both types of membranes are used to support bone regeneration in oral surgeries, such as dental implants.</p></p>
