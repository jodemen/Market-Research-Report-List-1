<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ICT Probes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Short Stroke Test Probes</li><li>Long Stroke Test Probes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Short stroke test probes and long stroke test probes are two types of ICT (In-Circuit Test) probes used in the electronics industry. Short stroke test probes have a limited range of motion, typically used for testing PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards) with smaller components and dense layouts. On the other hand, long stroke test probes have a greater range of motion, allowing them to reach deeper into the PCB and test components located further apart. Both types of probes play a crucial role in the troubleshooting and quality control of electronic devices.</p></p>
