<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nuclear Imaging Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positron Emission Tomography</li><li>Single-photon Emission Computed Tomography</li><li>Planar Scintigraphy Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Nuclear Imaging Systems are divided into three main types: Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Single-photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), and Planar Scintigraphy Systems. PET imaging uses radioactive tracers to create detailed 3D images of body tissues and functions. SPECT imaging also uses radioactive tracers but produces 3D images of organs and tissues by detecting gamma rays. Planar Scintigraphy Systems create 2D images of organs and tissues using a gamma camera. Each type of imaging system has its own unique applications and benefits in the field of nuclear medicine.</p></p>
