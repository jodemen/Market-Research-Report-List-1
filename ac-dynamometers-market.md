<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The AC Dynamometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Cooled</li><li>Water Cooled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>AC dynamometers are commonly categorized into two types based on the cooling method employed â€“ air cooled and water cooled. Air cooled dynamometers use air flow to dissipate heat generated during operation, making them suitable for applications where water cooling is not feasible. On the other hand, water cooled dynamometers utilize a water cooling system to maintain optimal operating temperatures. Water cooled dynamometers are typically used in high-performance applications where precise control of temperatures is required to ensure accurate testing and measurement.</p></p>
