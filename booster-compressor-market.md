<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Booster Compressor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air-cooled</li><li>Water-cooled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Booster compressors can be classified into two main types based on their cooling systems: air-cooled and water-cooled. Air-cooled booster compressors use air to dissipate heat generated during compression, making them suitable for applications where water availability may be limited. On the other hand, water-cooled booster compressors utilize water to cool down the compressed air, offering better cooling efficiency for high-demand operations. Both types of booster compressors have their unique advantages and are chosen based on the specific requirements of the application.</p></p>
