<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Magnesium Hydroxide Flame Retardants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemical Synthesis</li><li>Physical Smash</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Magnesium hydroxide flame retardants are divided into two main types - chemical synthesis and physical smash. Chemical synthesis involves the creation of magnesium hydroxide through chemical reactions in a controlled laboratory setting. On the other hand, physical smash refers to the process of obtaining magnesium hydroxide by physically breaking down minerals containing the compound. Both methods have their own advantages and applications in the flame retardant market, with chemical synthesis generally being more precise and controllable, while physical smash may be more cost-effective in certain cases.</p></p>
