<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Space Heating Boilers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-condensing Boilers</li><li>Condensing Boilers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Space heating boilers are heating systems used in buildings to provide warmth through the use of hot water or steam. There are two main types of space heating boilers: non-condensing boilers and condensing boilers. Non-condensing boilers are traditional boilers that release exhaust gases through a chimney, while condensing boilers are more energy-efficient as they recapture heat from exhaust gases. The market for non-condensing boilers is still prevalent, but the demand for condensing boilers is increasing due to their higher efficiency and lower environmental impact.</p></p>
