<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wall Hung Gas Boiler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Condensing</li><li>Non-Condensing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wall Hung Gas Boilers are classified into two main types: Condensing and Non-Condensing. Condensing boilers are more energy efficient than non-condensing boilers as they are designed to extract heat from the flue gases that would otherwise be wasted. This results in lower energy consumption and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Non-condensing boilers, on the other hand, do not have this feature and therefore have lower efficiency levels. Both types are commonly used in residential and commercial buildings for heating purposes.</p></p>
