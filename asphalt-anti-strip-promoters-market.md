<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Asphalt Anti-strip Promoters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Amine Anti-Stripping Agent</li><li>Amine-free Anti-stripping Agent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Asphalt anti-strip promoters are used to improve the adhesion of asphalt with aggregates in pavement construction. There are two main types of anti-strip agents on the market: amine anti-stripping agents and amine-free anti-stripping agents. Amine anti-stripping agents contain a chemical compound called amine, which helps enhance the bond between asphalt and aggregates. On the other hand, amine-free anti-stripping agents do not contain any amine compounds and rely on different chemical mechanisms to achieve the same goal of preventing moisture-induced damage in asphalt pavements.</p></p>
