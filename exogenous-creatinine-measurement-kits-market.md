<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Exogenous Creatinine Measurement Kits Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Jaffe's Kinetic Method</li><li>Enzymatic Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Exogenous creatinine measurement kits are used to determine the levels of creatinine, a waste product in the blood, for clinical diagnosis. There are two types of measurement methods commonly used: Jaffe's kinetic method and enzymatic method. Jaffe's kinetic method measures creatinine levels by detecting the color change caused by the reaction between creatinine and a reagent. On the other hand, the enzymatic method utilizes enzymes to convert creatinine into a measurable product. Both methods are widely utilized in the market for accurate and efficient creatinine measurement.</p></p>
