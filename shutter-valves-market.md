<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shutter Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Automatic</li><li>Manual</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Shutter valves come in two main types - automatic and manual. Automatic shutter valves are equipped with sensors or controllers that adjust the valve's opening and closing based on preset parameters. This type is preferred for applications requiring precise and automated control. On the other hand, manual shutter valves require human intervention to operate, making them suitable for situations where operators need to have direct control over the flow. Both types offer their own set of advantages and are chosen based on the specific requirements of the application.</p></p>
